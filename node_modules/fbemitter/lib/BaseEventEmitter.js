/**
 * @class BaseEventEmitter
 * @description
 * An EventEmitter is responsible for managing a set of listeners and publishing
 * events to them when it is told that such events happened. In addition to the
 * data for the given event it also sends a event control object which allows
 * the listeners/handlers to prevent the default behavior of the given event.
 *
 * The emitter is designed to be generic enough to support all the different
 * contexts in which one might want to emit events. It is a simple multicast
 * mechanism on top of which extra functionality can be composed. For example, a
 * more advanced emitter may use an EventHolder and EventFactory.
